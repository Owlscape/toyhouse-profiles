				<!-- SUMMARY ------------------------------------->

				<p>My &quot;Truesona&quot; or &quot;Fursona&quot;. AJ is a Golden Hooded Ferret. I just really love the hooded marking on domesticated pet rats and decided to put it on a cute little ferret bod since they&#39;re both my favorites.
					<br>

					<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Generally pretty positive. Loves to smile and make jokes and puns. Wants to look on the brighter side of things, including all of her problems. Has some major trust issues and can find it hard to get close to new people because of this, but overall very friendly and easy to socialize with. She can get a little too excited about her passions. Tries hard not to complain but often whines about her aches and pains. When she gets angry, she&#39;ll glare you down. When hurt she pushes everyone away and secludes herself. Hates to admit it, but she&#39;s very lonely.
						<br>
						
						<br><strong>Disability & Chronic Health Issues:</strong> Depression, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Fibromyalgia. I&#39;m choosing to list these because they effect me and will also effect my character. I often will draw vent art featuring her and my chronic issues. I&#39;d like to get more artwork showing her casually dealing with her disabilities. Example: art of her self indulging to cheer up, taking hot soaks or heat soaking her hands, taking medications/injections, wearing braces to help her move, just to name some.
						<br><br>
						
						<strong>Pets & Companions:</strong><br>
						
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/48810.pillowing-cherish">Cherish Pillowing</a>: The first pillowing AJ Ferret ever adopted and convinced her to be hooked on the species. They are two of the same coin and know all of each other's shorthand.
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/186454.pillowing-butter-bae">Butter Bae Pillowing</a>: AJ's second pillowing, she couldn't resist that clownish personality.
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/925363.pillowing-zippity">Zippity Pillowing</a>: AJ got to watch this pillowing be designed and created in shop, by the time zippity was ready for sale AJ caved and bought them.
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/2457086.pillowing-bunzie-bee-brigette">Bunzie Pillowing</a>: A personal gift from the pillowing creator Dolly to her friend AJ. A small comfort friend to help with anxiety attacks, especially when traveling.
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/983468.pillowing-amber">Amber Pillowing</a>: A therapy pillowing AJ adopted to help her with sleep and getting around the house. For being such a large pillowing it's very impressive how nimble Amber is!
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/1903027.pillowing-kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope Pillowing</a>: AJ bought this pillowing as a birthday gift for themselves. 
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://toyhou.se/5759398.pillowing-altocumulus">Alto</a> & <a href="https://toyhou.se/346006.pillowing-niobe">Niobe</a> Pillowings: AJ isn't really sure how she ended up adopting these two mystery pillowings, but they are in her house now and she's keeping them both. They seem to be a bonded pair? </p>

				<!-- TRIVIA ------------------------------------->

				<p class="font-weight-bold pb-0 mb-0">Trivia</p>
				<ul>
					<li>She almost always wears support tanks and shorts/pj bottoms of some sort. Anything comfy.</li>
					<li>This character is not available for gift sexual artwork of AJ ferret. Please ask permission first. AJ Ferret is married and in a monogamous commitment, so she will not be available for guesting in commission artwork with another character other than Prov Polar Bear.</li>
					<li>Has 2 tattoos. AJ ferret has three solid five-point stars on her left hand between her pointer finger and thumb. The second tattoo is an arm circlet wrapping around the bicep of her right arm, when the ends meet they curl away from each other with an outline of a five-point star on each side.</li>
